					<p>Welcome! You are here, you see this, that means that I at some point coded this site. I had to learn how to make it, I laid it out, styled it and published it. Crazy thing is, when I started I had no idea what any of this meant! Web development as a whole felt like an alien technology to me, but I can now tell you that it is not. When I wrote this and made this page, I was about 4 months into teaching myself web development. I had mostly been focusing on HTML and CSS while dabbling in some Javascript (I wanted to feel very comfortable with HTML and CSS and the different methods of doing things). Now, when I look at a website, I know how to inspect its elements to get ideas, I can read the code and know what it means (for the most part) and I can sit down and make sites like this one.</p><br>
					<p>I made this page to help you get started with web development. I am going to try to keep it all as simple as possible, and will try to explain everything from a beginner perspective. I will also try to keep my opinions out of it, so you can in the end decide what works for you!</p>

					<p>Before you start doing anything, you need to get all the tools in your toolbox to be able to do the job. Here is the kicker, there are MILLIONS of tools, so choosing one or two will mostly be up to you! For the purposes of this article I will go over 3 main things: Getting a code editor, setting up github, and info on how to use chrome developer tools</p><br>
					<header id="Code_editors">Code Editors and IDE's</header>
					<p>There are many code editors out there and many IDE's to choose from. Which one you choose will depend mostly on preference, but also on what you want to accomplish, whether its a native Windows App written in C#, or a simple website written in HTML CSS and JS. If you are looking at this then I am assuming that you are a newbie like me, so I will go over some basic text editors that I have used</p><br>

					<h5>Sublime Text editor</h5>
					<p>Sublime is an awesome text editor that is free (for the most part) and it is the one that I used to make this site and all my others. It is awesome for a few reasons:
						<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>It is very user friendly</li>
							<li>It is very light weight and fast</li>
							<li>It is free (not technically but you can ignore the prompt to purchase and it always works)</li>
							<li>It is always being updated to support new languages</li>
							<li>It is the same across all operating systems</li>
						</ul> 
					It is not so awesome for a few reasons:
					<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>You will need to install a handful of plugins before you can benefit from ST’s full potential.</li>
							<li>Git integration is somehow a bit shallow compared to other editors.</li>
							<li>If you decide to purchase it, it is $70 which is a bit steep for an editor.</li>
						</ul>

					</p><br>
					<h5>Atom Text editor</h5>
					<p>Atom is another light-weight and fast text editor that I have seen many developers use when watching Youtube videos. It is awesome for these reasons:
						<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>It is completely free.</li>
							<li>Very active community or users and lots of resources/tutorials on Github/Medium, etc.</li>
							<li>The file-tree-view is really nice and perhaps the best one across all editors.</li>
							<li>Lots of support from Github crew since they own it.</li>
							<li>It is the same across all operating systems.</li>
						</ul> 
					It is not so awesome for a few reasons:
					<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>Takes some time to get the right setup.</li>
							<li>Has some issues handling large repos/folders and CPU usage can go pretty high. It’s a browser-based app (runs on Electron), and is a bit slow to load and sometimes to respond.</li>
							<li>Most of the core is written in CoffeeScript, but the Github team is transitioning to ES6.</li>
							<li>Strange syntax management sometimes, you get a different color for your variable name depending on what you typed before (const, let, var etc.).</li>
						</ul>

					<h5>Brackets</h5>
					<p>Brackets is another really good and fast text editor. I have used it in the past but have since decided to go with Sublime. It is awesome for a few reasons:
						<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>It is Free!</li>
							<li>It does Code completion out of the box.</li>
							<li>The split window mode is really easy to use and intuitive.</li>
							<li>When you mark any HTML element and press Cmd/Ctrl + E, Brackets opens all CSS associated with this element inline in the current window. From here, you can make any edits you need. Once you close it, any changes will automatically be applied to the stylesheet connected with this element. Nice!</li>
						</ul> 
					It is not so awesome for a few reasons:
					<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>Needs plugins and packages to really be complete.</li>
							<li>Supports only web languages out of the box.</li>
							<li>Can also be slow at times but no big deal (especially compared to Atom).</li>
						</ul>

					<h5>Visual Studio Code</h5>
					<p>Visual studio code is a very popular text coding program especially in enterprise settings. The developers where I work use it to write their .NET and C# applications. I used it once or twice to try and get a node server going using npm. It is awesome for a few reasons:
						<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>It is stable.</li>
							<li>It is fast.</li>
							<li>It is reliable.</li>
							<li>It has a debugger built in.</li>
						</ul> 
					It is not so awesome for a few reasons:
					<ul class="bodyList">
							<li>The interface is not as polished as some of the other text editors.</li>
							<li>The navigation system is a bit odd.</li>
							<li>You can only get it on Microsoft.</li>
						</ul>

					<header id="Setting_up_github">Setting up Github</header>
					<p>If you have heard anything about web development or development in general, then you have heard of Github. Github is an open source community where people can collaborate and share there work. Most job postings I have seen have required knowledge of Github, or Git in general. To set up and learn how to use Github, follow <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">this</a> link and you will be on your way!</p><br>

					<p>Ok, now that you got your environment set up and somewhat know how it works, now its time to get into the fun part, HTML. I would make a write up on it, but there is an amazing resource called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> which will be able to show you anything you want to learn about HTML and otherwise.

				<header>Laying out Content</header>
				<article>
					<p>There are several different ways to lay out your content in the web browser. As a newbie, I can tell you that the sheer amount of difference in opinions of which to use can sometimes be overwhelming. I have personally used all three at least once, so I will list some pros and cons of each so that you can make your own decision on which to use.</p><br>
					<h4>Manual Layouts</h4>
					<p>One way of laying out a site is by using margins and relative positioning. This is pretty much what I did for this site, just to see if I could make something without Bootstrap like I always do. You have to manually set the margins, widths and heights, then you have to do some extensive media queries to get it all to work on mobile. For example, to make the sidebar on this site, I did the following CSS for an id of Navbar: <code>#Navbar {top: 0; left: 0; height 100%; width: 200px;} </code> Looks simple right! Well here is the thing, how are you gonna get the rest of the content to the right? well, if your viewport is fully expanded, you could simply add a <code> margin-left: 200px</code> so that the content starts 200px from the left of the screen leaving space for the sidebar. The main pro about this method is that it will work with pretty much all browsers, since it is just plain CSS.</p><br>
					<h4>Bootstrap 4</h4>
					<p>Bootstrap is a full framework which provides pre-defined classes, which makes it easy to create a layout and make it all responsive. I personally prefer Bootstrap and have used it on all my projects except this one. Basically, to use Bootstrap, you just link to the CDN (or download it once you get to backend stuff) then start using its layout system and predefined classes. One of the coolest parts about Bootstrap is the layout system. In the layout system you have containers, rows and colums. If you wanted to make three cards in line, for example, you would just make a div class of "container" (or container-fluid for full width) then a div class of row, then 3 columns of col-sm-3. There are 12 columns in Bootstrap, so if you want two side boxes that are equal, you can use col-sm-6 twice. I know this is an extreme simplification of it.

					<h4>CSS Grid</h4>
					<p>CSS grid is a fairly new way of laying out content on a webpage which simplifies the HTML needed to lay content out. I have tried using it but had issues with cross browser compatibility. For more info on CSS grid visit <a href="https://medium.com/flexbox-and-grids/how-to-efficiently-master-the-css-grid-in-a-jiffy-585d0c213577">this</a> link.</p>

				<header>Adding CSS</header>
				<article>
					<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. Without CSS, websites would look like the first HTML website ever made: <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"></a> CSS adds color, styling and more to your page, and is what makes websites look so good. For example, if you were to just add an image from a website using <code>img src="image.google.com"</code> it would default to whatever the image size is from the source. To fix this, you would go into your CSS document and select the Img tag, then change the properties like so: <code>img {width: 450px; height: auto;}.</code> The following code would make all images have a width of 450px and the height would be calculated depending on its aspect ration. If you wanted to control each image separately, you would have to add a class to the image such as <code> img class="image1"</code> then add the CSS: <code> .image1 {width: 450px; height: auto;} </code> To get started with CSS, head over to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">W3 Schools</a> to learn more!</p>

				<article>
					<p>Javascript is what makes websites interactive. It can be used for so many things including online game controllers, calculators, validation, editing html and css on the fly, etc. The awesome thing about Javascript is that it has so many frameworks so you can accomplish so many different things. I have not gotten too much into Javascript yet so I will just link you to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> so you can go check it out.</p><br>
					<p>Now keep in mind, I just made this for a project for Free Code Camp, but I will go back and keep updating it once I learn some more, and will most likely turn it into a blog. Thanks for checking it out.</p>
